Machine-Learning Algorithms in the research 

1. Pineal gland radiomics.
2. Serum metallomics in classifying NC and AD.
3. Serum metallomics in predicting MMSE and MOCA scores.



All the trained models from the three experiments have been saved in different folders in the specified locations, and to ensure that the results can be reproduced, we will make all the training and test set data public, so you can use our trained models to test the test set directly.
